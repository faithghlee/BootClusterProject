# BootClusterProject
STAT 840 Course group project 
Summary: 

Clustering of similar individuals is an unsupervised learning problem. In this project, my team member and I simulated longitudinal datasets. 
Our goal is to implement a clustering procedure to find out which cluster each individual belongs to by extracting information from their time-dependent and time-independent aspects. 
The write-up is in Group29.pdf. The code for data generation, bootstrapping + co-clustering is available in the repository.
